    "In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between most of the variables. For instance, the year variable has an impact on all the other variables including, global sales, other sales, EU sales, NA sales, JP sales. The result of this may be the improvement of the technology year after year. And what confirms this is that Europe, Japan, and North America sales were all increasing together along with incease the year. Also, I observed that the number of video games started to increase year by year. However, in 2009 the number of videos games released started to decrease.DS and PS2 platforms have the highest number of video games released among all other platforms. In addition, the action video games has the highest number of released and here are only few puzzle video games.\n",
